## What Changed

This is a patch release addressing community feedback from [Discussion #754](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure/discussions/754) about upgrade difficulties and missing preferences.

### 1. Upgrade Path Documentation

The main README now has separate **Fresh Install** and **Upgrading from a Previous Version** sections with explicit steps:

- Back up before upgrading
- The installer auto-detects existing installations
- `settings.json` merges intelligently (only installer-managed fields are updated)
- `USER/` files are never touched
- Post-upgrade checklist included

### 2. Temperature Unit Preference

New `preferences` section in `settings.json`:

```json
"preferences": {
  "temperatureUnit": "fahrenheit"
}
```

- **Installer asks** during the identity step — choose Fahrenheit or Celsius
- **Statusline honors the setting** — reads from `settings.json`, passes to Open-Meteo API, displays the correct °F or °C symbol
- **Existing users** can change it manually in `settings.json` at any time
- Default: `fahrenheit` (configurable during install)

### 3. Statusline Bug Fixes

Community-reported fixes from PRs [#762](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure/pull/762), [#780](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure/pull/780), and [#806](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure/pull/806):

- **Hardcoded timezone removed** — now reads `principal.timezone` from `settings.json` instead of hardcoded `America/Los_Angeles`
- **Broken context fallback removed** — the `/clear` command produced stale context percentages from a manual token calculation
- **Startup estimate removed** — the self-calibrating startup estimate cached previous session data, inflating fresh session context %
- **f-string syntax fix** — nested escaped double quotes inside Python f-strings caused parse errors on some shells

### 4. FAQ Fixes

- **Removed stale Python reference** — PAI v4.0 is TypeScript and Bash, not Python
- **Improved "What if I break something?" answer** — Now explains that USER/ is preserved, settings merge not overwrite, and backup strategy

## Files Changed (from v4.0.0)

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `settings.json` | Added `preferences.temperatureUnit` field |
| `statusline-command.sh` | Temp unit pref, dynamic timezone, context/startup/f-string fixes |
| `PAI-Install/engine/types.ts` | Added `temperatureUnit` to collected data and PAIConfig |
| `PAI-Install/engine/config-gen.ts` | Outputs `preferences` section |
| `PAI-Install/engine/actions.ts` | Temp unit prompt in identity step, preserves preferences on upgrade |

## Installation

### Fresh Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure.git
cd Personal_AI_Infrastructure/Releases/v4.0.1

cp -r .claude ~/ && cd ~/.claude && bash install.sh
```

### Upgrading from v4.0.0

```bash
# 1. Back up
cp -r ~/.claude ~/.claude-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# 2. Clone and copy
git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure.git
cd Personal_AI_Infrastructure/Releases/v4.0.1
cp -r .claude ~/

# 3. Run the installer
cd ~/.claude && bash install.sh

# 4. Rebuild CLAUDE.md
bun ~/.claude/PAI/Tools/BuildCLAUDE.ts
```

### Quick Manual Upgrade (from v4.0.0)

If you just want the temperature unit fix without re-running the installer:

1. Add to your `~/.claude/settings.json`:
```json
"preferences": {
  "temperatureUnit": "celsius"
}
```

2. Copy the updated `statusline-command.sh` from this release over your existing one.

3. Delete your weather cache to force a refresh:
```bash
rm -f ~/.claude/MEMORY/STATE/weather-cache.json
```

## Upgrading from Older Versions

See the [main README](../../README.md#upgrading-from-a-previous-version) for the general upgrade procedure. The installer auto-detects existing installations regardless of which version you're upgrading from.
